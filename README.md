## Hi, I’m @Plawska
 I’m a lawyer trying to rebrand and get a job in IT
 After some research, I've decided that I need to:
* [ ] get somewhat familliar with Linux OS
* [ ] try my first steps in virtualization
* [ ] read about basic networking topics
* [ ] learn how to use some sniffer, preferably wireshark

Check my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-plawska/

Do you think this plan might work?
